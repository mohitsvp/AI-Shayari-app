# Shayari Generation Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the Shayari Generation web application. The backend is built using Express.js and interacts with the OpenAI API to generate Shayari based on user-provided keywords.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- OpenAI API key

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/shayari-generation-backend.git
    cd shayari-generation-backend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```


3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide your OpenAI API key:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    PORT=8000
    ```
    
    Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

4. Start the server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

    
    The server will run on port 8000 by default. You can change the `PORT` value in the `.env` file.
